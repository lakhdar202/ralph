### Algorithm Details:
The TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) implementation follows these steps:
1. **Build Decision Matrix**: Extract candidate values for each attribute
2. **Normalize**: Vector normalization (value / sqrt(sum of squares))
3. **Apply Weights**: Multiply normalized values by attribute weights
4. **Find Ideal Solutions**: 
   - A+ (best): max for beneficial, min for non-beneficial attributes
   - A- (worst): min for beneficial, max for non-beneficial attributes
5. **Calculate Distances**: Euclidean distance from each candidate to A+ and A-
6. **Closeness Score**: D- / (D+ + D-) — higher = better
7. **Rank**: Sort by closeness score descending

### Verified:
- Ran TOPSIS analysis on "Senior Software Developer" position
- 2 candidates: Jane Doe (8 yrs exp, 90 technical, 85 comm) vs John Smith (5 yrs exp, 8 technical, 7 comm)
- Jane Doe ranked #1 with 100% closeness score (🥇)
- John Smith ranked #2 with 0% closeness score (🥈)
- Winner card displays correctly with trophy emoji
- Rankings table shows all data correctly
- Ideal Best/Worst cards show normalized weighted values
- Analysis saved to history and appears in Recent Analyses sidebar
